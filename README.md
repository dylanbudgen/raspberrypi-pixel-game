## Raspberry Pi Pixel Game with the Sense Hat
I made very simple pixel game to learn the basics of python. The game requires a Raspberry Pi with an official Sense Hat, however the code can be modified to use an emulator. 

### How to play 
The player is the blue pixel and the enemies are the red pixels. Avoid landing on the same pixel as an enemy to survive. A point is scored for every move you are not consumed.
